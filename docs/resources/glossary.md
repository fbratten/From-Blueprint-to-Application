> Key terminology from "From Blueprint to Application"

---

## A

**Agent** - An AI system that can take actions autonomously, make decisions, and work toward goals without constant human direction.

**API (Application Programming Interface)** - The interface through which applications communicate with AI models.

## C

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** - A prompting technique that encourages the AI to show its reasoning process step by step.

**Context Window** - The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that an AI model can process in a single interaction.

**Context Engineering** - The practice of designing and managing the information provided to AI systems to optimize their outputs.

## F

**Few-Shot Learning** - Providing examples in the prompt to help the AI understand the desired output format or style.

**Fine-Tuning** - Customizing a pre-trained AI model with additional training data for specific use cases.

## H

**Hallucination** - When an AI generates false or fabricated information that appears plausible.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - A standardized protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources.

**Multi-Agent System** - Multiple AI agents working together, each with specialized roles and capabilities.

## P

**Prompt** - The input text or instructions given to an AI model.

**Prompt Engineering** - The systematic practice of designing, optimizing, and refining prompts to achieve desired AI outputs.

**Prompt Injection** - A security vulnerability where malicious instructions are hidden within input to manipulate AI behavior.

**Prompt Library** - A centralized collection of tested, optimized prompts for organizational use.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - A technique that enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant information from external sources.

**Role Prompting** - Assigning a specific persona or expertise to the AI (e.g., "You are an expert technical writer").

## S

**System Prompt** - Instructions that define the AI's behavior across an entire conversation, typically set by the application developer.

## T

**Temperature** - A parameter controlling the randomness/creativity of AI outputs (lower = more deterministic, higher = more creative).

**Token** - The basic unit of text processing for AI models. Roughly 4 characters or 3/4 of a word in English.

**Tool Use** - The ability of AI models to call external functions or APIs to accomplish tasks.

## Z

**Zero-Shot** - Asking an AI to perform a task without providing examples in the prompt.
